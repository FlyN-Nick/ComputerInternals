# ComputerInternals

Use [Logism Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) to simulate my [CPU](https://github.com/FlyN-Nick/ComputerInternals/blob/master/CPU.circ).

[assembler.py](https://github.com/FlyN-Nick/ComputerInternals/blob/master/assembler/assembler.py) assembles assembly code to machine code for my simulated CPU and [disassembler.py](https://github.com/FlyN-Nick/ComputerInternals/blob/master/assembler/disassembler.py) disassembles machine code back to assembly code.
