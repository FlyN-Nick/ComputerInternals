# ComputerInternals

Use [Logism Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) to simulate my [CPU](https://github.com/FlyN-Nick/ComputerInternals/blob/master/CPU.circ).

[LogismAssembler.py](https://github.com/FlyN-Nick/ComputerInternals/blob/master/Assembler/LogismAssembler.py) assembles assembly code to machine code for my simulated CPU.
